# NJTOKKI
a website dedicated to the kpop group New Jeans and their fandom known as Tokki or “bunnies.” 
As a casual fan of New Jeans, I enjoy listening to their music and their aesthetic is incredibly cute. NJTOKKI was created to be a safe space for fans to engage with each other or just use as a place to listen to the group’s discography while studying, cooking, or doing any activity. 

Basically, I want to create a landing page on New Jeans. There will be music automatically playing with the basic options to pause, play, skip, or go back. A sliding element that introduces each member. An element that has their upcoming events and links to all their official social media. A forum page for fans to communicate with each other. I have many ideas, but for now these are what I have in mind.
